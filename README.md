# Triple-Threshold-Statistical-Detection-filter-for-removing-high-density-random-valued-impulse-noise-
In this project we have implemented a noise detection algorithm which detects noisy pixels in images corrupted by random-valued impulse noise of high levels up to 80% noise density,we have used an algorithm for detecting and filtering high density random-valued impulse noise (RVIN) in pictures.In random-valued impulse noise, noisy pixels are randomly present between 0 and 255, and so, it is difficult to detect the noise and restore the image. Three levels of adaptive thresholds, have been used so as to eliminate the misdetection of noise-free pixels as noisy pixels and vice versa. A noise signature has been calculated for each pixel of the image and compared with the first threshold to identify noise and then the central pixel is compared with the second and third levels of thresholds.
